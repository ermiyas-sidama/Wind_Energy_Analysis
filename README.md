# Wind_Energy_Power_Analysis
## Introduction
Climate change is a global problem which requires actions to be taken globally. The effects of climate change resulting from the increased levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere are becoming increasingly visible. In order to reduce these impacts and prevent the climate crisis, countries have commenced developing climate-neutral policies by focusing on clean technologies.

Wind power; is a natural, renewable, clean, and infinite power and its source is the sun. A small amount of 1-2% of the energy that the sun sends to the earth turns into wind energy. Airflow occurs due to the difference in temperature and pressure that occurs as a result of the sun not heating the ground surface and atmosphere homogeneously.([2](https://enerji.gov.tr/eigm-resources))

A wind turbine is a device that converts the kinetic energy of wind into electrical energy. As of 2020, hundreds of thousands of large turbines, in installations known as wind farms, were generating over 650 GW of power, with 60 GW added each year.([3](https://wwindea.org/world-wind-capacity-at-650-gw))

Wind power generates about 10% of Turkey's electricity, mainly in the west in the Aegean and Marmara regions, and is gradually becoming a larger share of renewable energy in the country. As of 2024, Turkey has 12 gigawatts (GW) of wind turbines. The Energy Ministry plans to have almost 30 GW by 2035, including 5 GW offshore.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to analyze and forecast wind energy production in Turkey using time series analysis techniques. By understanding wind energy data, we aim to develop predictive models that can help in planning and optimizing wind energy usage.

## Business Problem
The Turkey Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources is responsible for ensuring the country's energy security, promoting sustainable energy development, and supporting the integration of renewable energy sources into the national grid. Wind power is a significant component of Turkey's renewable energy strategy due to its abundant wind resources. 

The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources needs a reliable method to accurately predict wind power generation on an hourly basis. This prediction is essential for:

- __Grid Stability__ : Ensuring a stable and balanced power grid by effectively managing the variability of wind power.
- __Energy Trading__: Making informed decisions about energy trading in local and international markets.
- __Resource Allocation__: Optimizing the allocation of energy resources, including the balance between renewable and non-renewable energy sources.
## Data and Resource Used
For this project a ([dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkerisen/wind-turbine-scada-dataset)) taken from a wind turbine's scada system that is working and generating power in Turkey. In Wind Turbines, Scada Systems measure and save data's like wind speed, wind direction, generated power etc. for 10 minutes intervals.
### Data definition
The data's in the file are:
- __Date/Time__ (for 10 minutes intervals)
- __LV ActivePower__ (kW): The power generated by the turbine for that moment
- __Wind Speed__ (m/s): The wind speed at the hub height of the turbine (the wind speed that turbine use for electricity generation)
- __Theoretical_Power_Curve__ (KWh): The theoretical power values that the turbine generates with that wind speed which is given by the turbine manufacturer
- __Wind Direction__ (°): The wind direction at the hub height of the turbine (wind turbines turn to this direction automaticly)

## Data Preprocessing
- Drop negative and zero LV Activepower
- Stationarty Check
- Seasonal decomposition in time series analysis is a crucial technique used to separate a time series into its fundamental components.

Trend: The long-term movement or direction in the data, indicating the general tendency of the series (e.g., upward, downward).
Seasonality: Regular, repeating patterns or cycles in the data that occur at fixed intervals (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly).
Residual (or Irregular): The random noise or irregular component, which represents the fluctuations that cannot be attributed to trend or seasonality.
To show the seasonal decomposition clearly I limited the dataset to 100 records only.

## Analysis / Modeling
For the wind energy power analysis AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average model(__ARIMA__) is used to forcast the power output in hourly bases.
Two Data Points: I used two sets of data for testing the baseline model.

- __Long_Term_Forecasting__: This involves predicting outcomes far into the future. However, the baseline model didn't perform well with this dataset, possibly due to the complexity of long-term trends or insufficient data.

- __Short_Term_Forecasting__: Predicting outcomes in the near future. The baseline model performed better with this dataset, which could be because short-term trends are easier to capture or there's more data available for short-term analysis.
Then, Gridsearch and Auto ARIMA is used to tune our hyperparameters. Based on this, the best model was __ARIMA(3,1,2)__ which has a mean absolute error of __13%__.
#### The best model prediction has a mean absolute error of 13%

Here are the metrics for the best model
- __mae__  : 0.13162599893754348
- __mape__ : 0.12245984700173755
- __rmse__ : 0.1547621523674663
