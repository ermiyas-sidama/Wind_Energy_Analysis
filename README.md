## INTRODUCTION
Climate change is a global problem which requires actions to be taken globally. The effects of climate change resulting from the increased levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere are becoming increasingly visible. In order to reduce these impacts and prevent the climate crisis, countries have commenced developing climate-neutral policies by focusing on clean technologies.[1] (https://shura.org.tr/en/net-zero-2053-energy-sector-policies/)

Wind power; is a natural, renewable, clean, and infinite power and its source is the sun. A small amount of 1-2% of the energy that the sun sends to the earth turns into wind energy. Airflow occurs due to the difference in temperature and pressure that occurs as a result of the sun not heating the ground surface and atmosphere homogeneously.[2](https://enerji.gov.tr/eigm-resources)

A wind turbine is a device that converts the kinetic energy of wind into electrical energy. As of 2020, hundreds of thousands of large turbines, in installations known as wind farms, were generating over 650 GW of power, with 60 GW added each year.[3](https://wwindea.org/world-wind-capacity-at-650-gw)

Wind power generates about 10% of Turkey's electricity, mainly in the west in the Aegean and Marmara regions, and is gradually becoming a larger share of renewable energy in the country. As of 2024, Turkey has 12 gigawatts (GW) of wind turbines. The Energy Ministry plans to have almost 30 GW by 2035, including 5 GW offshore.
